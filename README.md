#Starter for flask heroku project

Why? I can't find another template that actually passes
How? I actually got something to run, so I figure I should upload my template for myself and anyone else who finds this as annoying as I do.
What? Make all the web things.

#What you'll need:

Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask
gunicorn
python 2.x
pyscopg
